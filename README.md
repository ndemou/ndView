A fast image viewer that has helped me when cleaning up images.
 
USAGE
-----

Click the open folder icon, select the first screenshot and then use these keys:

LEFT/RIGHT view previous/next screenshot

BACKSPACE/DELETE delete* current then move to previous/next screenshot

Ctrl-Z undo last delete
 
 
*: In fact screenshots are never deleted but are just renamed to *.bak
